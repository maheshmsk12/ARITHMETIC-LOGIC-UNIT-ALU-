# DESCRIPTION: I worked on ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT ALU DESIGN in this task i wrote verilog code and test bentch and i do simulation in MODELSIM TOOL through simulation i verify functionality of design. â€œThe Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a key component of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) that performs arithmetic calculations and logical operations. In this task all codes like verilog and test bentch codes are written in Notepad++ and using modelsim tool i do simulation.Using these tools and steps, i clear understood the consept of Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
